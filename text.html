             in the user space that acts as an
              interface for the ULT to access 
              the physical CPU resources.
               Thread library schedules which 
               thread of a process to run on which
                LWP and how long. The number of LWPs 
                created by the thread library depends 
                on the type of application. 
                In the case of an I/O bound application, 
                the number of LWPs depends on the number of user-level threads.
                 This is because when an LWP is blocked on an I/O operation, 
                 then to invoke the other ULT the thread library needs to create and schedule another LWP. 
                 Thus, in an I/O bound application, the number of LWP is equal to the number of the ULT.
                  In the case of a CPU-bound application, it depends only o
